### Why Flask-JWT-Extended?

Flask-JWT-Extended adds support for using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to Flask for protecting views.

This has several **optional** features built it to make working with JSON Web Tokens
easier. These include:

* Support for adding custom claims to JSON Web Tokens
* [Refresh tokens](https://auth0.com/blog/refresh-tokens-what-are-they-and-when-to-use-them/)
* Token freshness and separate view decorators to only allow fresh tokens
* Token revoking
* Storing tokens in cookies and CSRF protection
