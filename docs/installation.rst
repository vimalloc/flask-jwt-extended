Installation
==============



The easiest way to start working with this extension with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install flask-jwt-extended

If you want to use asymmetric (public/private) key signing algorithms, include
the ``asymmetric_crypto`` extra requirements.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install flask-jwt-extended[asymmetric_crypto]

Note that if you are using ZSH (probably other shells as well), you will need to escape the brackets

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install flask-jwt-extended\[asymmetric_crypto\]


If you prefer to install from source, you can clone this repo and run

.. code-block:: bash

  $ python setup.py install
