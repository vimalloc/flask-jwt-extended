### When to use Flask-JWT-Extended?

Flask-JWT-Extended not only adds support for using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to Flask for protecting views,
but also many helpful (and **optional**) features  built in to make working with JSON Web Tokens
easier. These include:

* Support for adding custom claims to JSON Web Tokens
* Custom claims validation on received tokens
* Creating tokens from complex objects or complex object from received tokens
* [Refresh tokens](https://auth0.com/blog/refresh-tokens-what-are-they-and-when-to-use-them/)
* Token freshness and separate view decorators to only allow fresh tokens
* Token revoking/blacklisting
* Storing tokens in cookies and CSRF protection

### When *not* to use Flask-JWT-Extended?

This extension is very opinionated about what claims need to exist in received
JWTs to get all these extra features to work. If you are working with other JWT
providers, only using Flask for rapid prototyping of your application, or do
not care about any of these extra features, [Flask-JWT-Simple](https://github.com/vimalloc/flask-jwt-simple)
may be a better fit for your application. It is the sister extension of this
one (both maintained by me), which strips all of the extra features and opinionated
JWT requirements out.
